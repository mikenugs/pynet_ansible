YAML and JSON are data structures that can be used to communicate between machines. When
you do this you are converting your data structure to a byte stream or in other words
serializing the data. These data structures are human readible. 

When writing YAML you typically add three hyphones to the top but this is not mandatory

---

- apple <- to write a list or an array you add one hyphone then a string, integer or some type of bolean
- orange <- This would be list element 1 and apple would be 0
- peach <- This would be list element 2

There should be no space for the list hyphen and the begining. Then one space before the element


Here we add to our list with different element data types
---

- apple pie <-- you do not need to put a hyphen around your strings Python will do that for you when converted
- orange
- banana
- peach
- 10
- 11.0
- true
- no
- off

!This python program will read in the YAML and convert it to Python data types

import yaml

def read_yaml(filename):
    with open(filename) as f:
        return yaml.safe_load(f)

def write_yaml(filename, output, style=None):
    with open(filename, "wt") as f:
        if style=="compressed":
            yaml.dump(output, f, default_flow_style=True)
        else:
yaml.dump(output, f, default_flow_style=False)

!To create a dictionary or what is known as a Hash Map in other programming languages

---

key1: value1 <-- there is a space between the key and value
key2: value2
key3: value3


!Below we have a list of dictionaries

---

# This is a commment
- ip_addr: 10.10.10.1
  username: admin
  password: whatever
  device_type: cisco_ios
- ip_addr: 10.10.10.2
  username: admin
  password: whatever
  device_type: juniper_srx

!Below we have a dictionary key my_list with a value which comprises of a list of varying data types
Note that we indent the list so it shows that it belongs to the key my_list

---

ip_addr: 10.10.10.1
username: admin
password: whatever
device_type: cisco_ios
my_list:
  - some value
  - 10
  - true
  - false
  - whatever

!You can also write a dictionary in compressed format, note that you do not need to qoute the values in the strings

---

# Showing YAML in compressed form
{ key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3 }

!Here is a list in compressed format again no qoutes on the strings

---

# Showing YAML in compressed form
[ whatever, 10, 10.1, false, true, some string ]

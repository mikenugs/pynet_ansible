Make sure you check your playbook structure for spacing. There is indentation for plays, tasks and arguments. 

Ansible knows where to find the core modules but for napalm or NTC you need to specify where Ansible can find these modules

If you get an error stating that it cannot find the module path edit ~/.ansible.cfg and check the library line. Make sure you add the module path such as ~/napalm-ansible/library: before or after the other paths

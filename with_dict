!By using with dict you can iterate over a dictionary in Python.

- name: With Testing
  hosts: local
  vars:
    my_devices:
      device1:
        ip_addr: 10.10.10.1
        device_type: cisco_ios
      device2:
        ip_addr: 10.10.20.1
        device_type: cisco_ios
      device3:
        ip_addr: 10.10.30.1
        device_type: juniper_junos
  tasks:
    - name: Test with_dict
      debug:
        msg: "{{ item }}" <-- This will print out the dictionary that will be placed in item as it iterates through with_dict. The item contains both the key/value pairs and will be the entire dictionary.
      with_dict: "{{ my_devices }}" <-- you specify with_dict to iterate through a dictionary and my_devices is the dictionary name that is defined under vars:

!If you want to match on just the key you can try to specify item.key like below.

  tasks:
    - name: Test with_dict
      debug:
        msg: "{{ item.key }}"
      with_dict: "{{ my_devices }}"

!You can also match just the values as well stripping out the keys when iterating through the dictionary like below.

  tasks:
    - name: Test with_dict
      debug:
        msg: "{{ item.value }}"
      with_dict: "{{ my_devices }}"

!If we want to reference an indivual variable inside the dictionary such as the ip_addr variable within the dictionary when we iterate through.

  tasks:
    - name: Test with_dict
      debug:
        msg: "{{ item.value.ip_addr }}"
      with_dict: "{{ my_devices }}"

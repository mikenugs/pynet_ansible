Instead of putting all of your variables in the inventory file you can
choose to store some in the group_vars and host_vars directory. The group_vars
and host_vars directory need to be relative to where the Ansible host file is
located.

!You will need to create a file in group_vars that matches your device names
such as creating a cisco.yml to match the cisco group in your inventory file
. You use yml to specify the variables

---
ntp1: 88.1.2.77
ntp2: 88.1.9.33

!Here we have a playbook that prints out those variables in group_vars

---
- name: Print out variables
  hosts: cisco
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ ntp1 }}"
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ ntp2 }}"

!You can also match specify hosts by creating a host_vars directory relative
to the inventory file.

If you have for example a host in your cisco group called pynet-rtr1 you
would make the directories /host_vars/pynet-rtr1/ and then add a file called
my_vars.yml for your variables

!Here we add the AS number to the file my_vars.yml

as_number: 10

!The group variables apply to all members in the group and the host variables
apply only to the hosts

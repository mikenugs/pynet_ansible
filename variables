!Variables can also be specified within the playbook by creating a vars key.

---
- name: Print out variables
  hosts: cisco
  vars:
    dns1: 8.8.8.8
    dns2: 8.8.4.4
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ dns1 }}"
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ dns2 }}"


!You can also specify a file that has variables as well using vars_files. Note
that when you specify the filename Ansible wants it input as a list

---
- name: Print out variables
  hosts: cisco
  vars:
    dns1: 8.8.8.8
    dns2: 8.8.4.4
  vars_files:
    - my_vars.yml <-- must be input as a list
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ ip_addr1 }}"

!my_vars.yml
---
ip_addr1: 10.10.10.1

!Ansible also has facts that it gathers from a device. They can be seen via
the setup module. After running the setup module to see all of the gathered facts
you can print out individual facts by specifying the variable name.

  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ ansible_all_ipv6_addresses }}"

!If you want to gather facts from a newworking device you will need to do something
special because by default we run connection local with networking devices.

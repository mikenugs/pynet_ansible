!When you need to save the running configuration to the startup configuration after making a
configuration change you can use Handlers. The way handlers work is if the task results in a change
and you specify a handler then the handler will be fired off. If there are no changes then 
the handler will never be fired off.

- name: NXOS Example
  hosts: nxos
  tasks:
    - name: Configure NEXUS VLANs
      nxos_vlan:
        provider: "{{ provider_nxapi }}"
        vlan_id: "{{ item.vlan_id }}"
        admin_state: "{{ item.admin_state }}"
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
      with_items: "{{ vlans }}"
      notify: write mem <-- The identifier string write mem matches the name of the handler

  handlers:
    - name: write mem
      nxos_command:
        provider: "{{ provider_ssh }}"
        commands: copy run start
      changed_when: True <-- This Playbook does not flag a change when it is run. You can set this if you want it to show changed
      tags: wr_mem

!You can also use handlers when working with linux in situations where you modify a config
file such as apache and then use ntofy a handler to restart the service in the case a change
was made.

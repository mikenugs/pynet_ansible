Conditionals are statements like if, elif else constructs that you see in programming languages.

- name: When Testing
  hosts: local
  vars:
    my_str: whatever

  tasks:
    - name: Hard-coded to False
      debug:
        msg: Hello World is False
      when: False

    - name: Hard-coded to True
      debug:
        msg: Hello World is True
      when: True

    - name: Testing string equality
      debug:
        msg: whatever
      when: my_str != 'whatever' <-- This will skip this task since it is saying that when my_str is not equal to whatever. 

    - name: Substring in larger string
      debug:
        msg: This is Cisco IOS
      when: "'Cisco IOS' in version" <-- Here we have to enclose a substring in the string using different quatation marks. We need to do this because if we did not Ansible would think it was one long string. 

    - name: This variable is defined
      debug:
        msg: Variable defined <-- This will print when the version is defined
      when: version is defined

    - command: /bin/false <-- This command will fail and force the Playbook to end
      register: result
      ignore_errors: True <-- By setting this to true we ignore the error and allow the playbook to run

    # The previous form using a filter was deprecated
    - debug:
        msg: "Hello world"
      when: result is failed <-- Since the last command failed and saved this in result this play will be true and print hello world
